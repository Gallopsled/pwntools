TL;DR version:
   Everything in pwntools is open source. Most is under an MIT license, but a
   few pieces are under GPL or a BSD 2-clause licence.

This license covers everything within this project, except for a few pieces
of code that we either did not write ourselves or which we derived from code
that we did not write ourselves. These few pieces have their license specified
in a header, or by a file called LICENSE.txt, which will explain exactly what
it covers. The few relevant pieces of code are all contained inside these
directories:

- pwnlib/constants/
- pwnlib/data/
