pwntools is a CTF framework and exploit development library. Written in Python, it is designed for rapid prototyping and development, and intended to make exploit writing as simple as possible.

```python
from pwn import *
context(arch = 'i386', os = 'linux')

r = remote('exploitme.example.com', 31337)
# EXPLOIT CODE GOES HERE
r.send(asm(shellcraft.sh()))
r.interactive()
```

# Try It Now!

You can now do a live demo of Pwntools, [right in your browser](http://demo.pwntools.com).  Alternately, you can SSH to the same host, and log in as user `zerocool` with [this private key][key] (password `i_promise_not_to_be_evil`).

It will drop you into a clean, Docker-ized container.  There is nothing of value on the VPS, so please don't be evil.

# Documentation
Our documentation is available at [pwntools.readthedocs.org](https://pwntools.readthedocs.org/)

To get you started, we've provided some example solutions for past CTF challenges in our [write-ups repository](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools-write-ups).

# Installation

pwntools is best supported on 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04, but most functionality should work on any Posix-like distribution (Debian, Arch, FreeBSD, OSX, etc.).  Python 2.7 is required.

Most of the functionality of pwntools is self-contained and Python-only.  You should be able to get running quickly with

```sh
apt-get update
apt-get install python2.7 python-pip python-dev git libssl-dev
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools.git
```

However, some of the features (assembling/disassembling foreign architectures) require non-Python dependencies.  For more information, see the [complete installation instructions here](https://pwntools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html).
