    findpeer(port)

    Finds a connected socket. If port is specified it is checked
    against the peer port. Resulting socket is left in r6.

    Example:
        >>> enhex(asm(shellcraft.findpeer(1337)))
        '6ff00006ee4606f101064ff001074fea072707f11f07f54630461fb401a96a4601df0130efdd01994fea11414ff039024fea022202f105029142e4d1'

    /* First four bytes will be the size of the address, the remaining 16 bytes will be */

    push {r0, r1, r2, r3, r4}

    /* Second argument is pointer to where to store inet addr */
    add r1, sp, #4

    /* Third argument is pointer to size */
    mov r2, sp

    /* Now issue system call */
