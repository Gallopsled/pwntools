This directory contains a script `download-useragents.py' which downloads a
list of user agent strings from the Internet.

The user agent strings are downloaded from:
 - http://www.user-agents.org
 - http://techpatterns.com/downloads/firefox/useragentswitcher.xml

The latter list is part of the Firefox `User Agent Switcher' add-on and
released under BSD 2 Clause.


As mentioned elsewhere we are not lawyers and do not know the legal status of
these lists.  To the extend that we can legally do so, we redistribute
everything under an MIT license, but otherwise we allow it under the licenses
the lists were originally made available under.
